# Machine learning repo

My submissions for Andrew Ng's machine learning [class](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning).
Includes exercises on Linear regression, polynomial regression, neural networks, logistic regression, support vector machines, 
K nearest neighbors, principal component analysis, recommender sytems, anomaly detection.

Also includes some sweet sweet bugs. 

Good luck.
